## Cryptography Toolkit Roadmap
**1. Project Purpose and Goals**

Purpose: To create an educational and practical cryptography toolkit in Python that demonstrates both historical and modern cryptographic methods.
Goals:
Provide a user-friendly interface for users to experiment with different cryptographic techniques.
Educate users on the basics of cryptography, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
Ensure the toolkit is modular, allowing for easy addition of new cryptographic methods in the future.


## 2. Current Features

Caesar Cipher: A simple substitution cipher with encryption and decryption capabilities.
Vigenère Cipher: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword for encryption and decryption.
AES Encryption: A modern symmetric encryption algorithm with support for encryption and decryption using a generated key and initialization vector (IV).
SHA-256 Hashing: A cryptographic hash function to generate a fixed-size hash from any input.
RSA Digital Signatures: An asymmetric algorithm for signing messages and verifying signatures using a private-public key pair.
Interactive Menu System: A user-friendly interface that allows users to select and use different cryptographic methods easily.

## 3. Key Milestones

Initial Setup: Set up the project structure, including the main script and necessary dependencies (e.g., pycryptodome).
Implementation of Basic Ciphers: Developed and integrated the Caesar and Vigenère ciphers.
Integration of Modern Cryptography: Added AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing functionalities.
Asymmetric Cryptography: Implemented RSA digital signatures.
User Interface Development: Created an interactive menu system for easy navigation and use.
Testing and Debugging: Conducted thorough testing to ensure each method works correctly and handles errors gracefully.

## 4. Future Enhancements

Additional Ciphers: Include more historical ciphers like the Playfair Cipher or modern ones like ChaCha20.
Key Management: Implement secure key generation, storage, and exchange mechanisms.
File Encryption: Extend AES to encrypt and decrypt entire files, not just messages.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI version using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for a better user experience.
Educational Resources: Add in-app tutorials or links to external resources for users to learn more about each cryptographic method.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for better performance, especially for resource-intensive operations like RSA.

## 5. Technical Considerations

Dependency Management: Ensure all dependencies are properly managed and documented.
Code Modularity: Keep the code modular to facilitate easy addition of new features.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage user inputs and cryptographic operations.
Security Best Practices: Follow best practices for secure coding, especially in cryptographic implementations.
Documentation: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

## 6. Timeline

Phase 1 (Completed): Initial setup and implementation of basic ciphers.
Phase 2 (Completed): Integration of modern cryptography and asymmetric methods.
Phase 3 (Completed): Development of the interactive menu system.
Phase 4 (Ongoing): Testing, debugging, and refinement.
Phase 5 (Future): Addition of new features and enhancements.

## 7. Summary
The Cryptography Toolkit project aims to educate users about cryptography through practical implementation in Python. It currently features a range of cryptographic methods from simple ciphers to modern encryption standards, all accessible via an interactive menu. Future plans include expanding the toolkit with more ciphers, improving user experience with a GUI, and adding educational resources. The project emphasizes modularity, security, and user-friendliness, making it a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with cryptography.
